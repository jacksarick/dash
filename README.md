To use, run `./build.sh`

You'll need to get your own data, so start the hack-with-ix API and run `./pages/data/aggregate.sh`

#The idea behind the playground

Say you want to launch an ad campaign. You look around the internet, find a DSP to bid for you, and use IX to get that ad to publishers. Cool. You launch your ad, but lo and behold: nothing. Your ad is a flop. Up until now you had two options: Spend money making more ads, testing what works and what doesn't, or quit. You're a doer, a starter, a go-getter, you're not going to quit! But you're still broke. Shit. Enter the Data Playground. We take IX's data from thousands and thousands of ads and figure out what works and what doesn't. We give you this information in a way you can understand. No crazy spreadsheets or overly dense graphs. Plain english, primary colours, simple shapes. Made for normal people, by normal people. This is the Playground.
