GET /

Hello world
GET /servers

Returns a list of servers
Response contains two fields, a "message" field containing a string and a "data" field containing an array.
Each member of the "data" field array contains the following fields:
"dc": A string containing the data centre the server is located in
"id": A string containing the unique ID of the server
"online": A number containing the UTC time at which the server was first onlined
"status":
"GREEN" if the server is functioning normally
"YELLOW" if the server is experiencing minor problems
"ORANGE" if the server is experiencing significant problems
"RED" if the server is experiencing critical problems
"GREY" if the server is offline
